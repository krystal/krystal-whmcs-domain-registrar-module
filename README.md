## About
This is a custom WHMCS module built for our resellers who would like to register domains directly though [us] (https://krystal.io).

## Installation
1. Download the module via the following [link](https://github.com/Krystal-Hosting/krystal-whmcs-domain-registrar-module/releases/latest)
1. Copy the `krystal` directory into the respective WHMCS directory in your WHMCS setup: `/whmcs/modules/registrars/`
2. Go to WHMCS, Setup, Domain Registrars and activate the `Krystal` registrar
3. Enter your API username and API secret. These can be obtained via your [client area](https://krystal.co.uk/client/account/apikeys).
4. Choose to pay via credit card. You must have one on file. This will ensure domains are registered/renewed when your WHMCS requests. If you do not want to use a credit card, you must have a credit balance on your account with Krystal.
